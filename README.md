Tanagra is a (in progress) binding generator and (eventually) support library for Vulkan.

Currently Tanagra is an `unsafe` library, but this is extremely temporary as I work out
the details of marshaling. Eventually I'd like to implement a `calli` interop scheme derived 
from the method used by [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk).

> You hoped that something like this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was a dangerous creature on this planet, and you knew from the tale of Darmok that a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here, at El-Adrel.
